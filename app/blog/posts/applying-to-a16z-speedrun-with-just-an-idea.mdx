# The Audacious Leap: Applying to A16Z SPEEDRUN with Just an Idea

I've been building softwares in different industries the Chinese market for a couple of years. Starting with an AI-driven Learning Management System (LMS) in the edtech sector thatscaled to over **1m+** users, I then went into social networking industry to develope a unique AI social network. Designed to forge instant, meaningful connections among users, we launched in China and gathered a user base of **500k+**, with about **2B+** daily token consumption.

Howeever,the challenges of fundraising in the Chinese market for non strong-profit-generating businesses led us to pivot towards the U.S. market. With little more than a concept for the American audience, we were essentially starting anewâ€”a daunting yet exhilarating prospect.

## Andrew Chen's Tweet

The journey took an unexpected turn when I came across a tweet from Andrew Chen about the A16Z SPEEDRUN program. Intrigued by the opportunity to accelerate our growth under the mentorship of one of the leading venture firms, I applied. The application process was surprisingly straightforward, taking just ten minutes to complete.

## The Interview Invitation

Weeks later, as we were deep in the throes of preparing for our U.S. launch, a surprising email arrived: an invitation to interview with A16Z SPEEDRUN. This news was both shocking and invigorating. It validated our belief in our product's potential and propelled us into high gear.

## The Preparation

With the interview scheduled for the following week, we had a scant two days to prepare amid our other launch activities. We concentrated on crafting a compelling narrative around our product's unique value proposition, technological innovation, and market potential. Despite the time constraints, we honed our presentation to be clear and impactful.

## The Interview Experience

The interview itself was brisk but comprehensive. We managed to convey our vision and the scalability of our idea without being frequently interrupted, allowing for a seamless presentation of our thoughts and plans.

## Constructive Feedback

The feedback from the SPEEDRUN team was straightforward and insightful. They recognized the innovation and potential of our platform but noted that our venture was still too early in its lifecycle for their program. They advised us to return with more substantial proof of concept and market traction.

This feedback, while initially disappointing, provided us with clear direction for our next steps. It highlighted the importance of demonstrating market validation and the ability to execute on our vision.

## Lessons Learned and Next Steps

The SPEEDRUN application process was a profound learning experience. It reinforced the necessity of pairing innovative ideas with solid evidence of market demand. With our U.S. launch underway and early traction indicators looking promising, we are better positioned for future opportunities.

We plan to reapply for the next cycle of SPEEDRUN, confident in our enhanced proposal that not only showcases our innovative idea but also the proof of its viability in the market.

## Conclusion: Forward with Resilience

To my fellow entrepreneurs, remember that each setback is a stepping stone towards your ultimate goal. Stay adaptable, learn from feedback, and continue to push the boundaries of innovation.
