#Never live in the moment

Recently, while diving deep into Marxist theory during a political science class, I began to question some widely accepted life philosophies. Marx, known for his critical approach to societal norms, always scrutinized the world around him, challenging abstract definitions and concepts that most people accept without much thought. Inspired by his perspective, I started to reevaluate a popular mantra: **"Live in the moment."**

At first glance, *live in the moment* appears to be an ideal way to live. It encourages us to cherish each instant and avoid being bogged down by past regrets or future anxieties. However, when we analyze this concept through the lens of Marx's emphasis on practicality, we might find that *living in the moment* differs from a planned, goal-oriented lifestyle only by the few minutes each day spent on future planning or worrying about potential issues.

This seemingly noble philosophy might actually lead us to neglect future planning and preparation, causing us to overlook critical aspects of personal growth, career development, and even daily life management. It's ironic that to avoid contemplating these essential elements, we've concocted a concept that sounds commendable but is fundamentally flawed.

Planning for the future does not mean we cannot enjoy or appreciate the present. On the contrary, by thoughtfully preparing for the future, we can ensure that our present moments are filled with purpose and meaning, allowing us to savor each instant more deeply.

We should adopt Marx's critical, reality-focused perspective and reassess the idea of *living in the moment*. Instead of blindly accepting this lifestyle, we need to recognize that true wisdom lies not in avoiding thoughts of the future but in balancing thoughtful planning with a deep appreciation for the present.

Ultimately, the minutes we invest each day in future planning and contemplation are invaluable for personal development, career growth, and improving our quality of life. Therefore, we should never simply *live in the moment* but rather find a balance between careful planning and experiencing the present, making our lives richer and more meaningful.
